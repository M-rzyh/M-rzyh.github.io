This paper presents **AurigaBot V1**, a cost-efficient autonomous vehicle platform that integrates a density-based lane keeping algorithm. The proposed system leverages optimized perception and control modules to achieve reliable path tracking under varying environmental conditions while maintaining low hardware costs.
